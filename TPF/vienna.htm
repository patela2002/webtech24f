        Vienna is the perfect destination for Christmas! Our entire-trip was filled with christmas market trips, and
        exploring!
        This itinerary is perfect for a weekend trip during christmas season!
    </p>

    <p>

        On our first day we got there in the afternoon, so we still had the day there. We stayed at an <a
            href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18785352?source_impression_id=p3_1731097553_P3QjlHATXf4AWbg4"
            target="_blank">Airbnb</a> that was
        a little out of the main city area, but it was very easy to get in. The public transport in Vienna is very
        reliable. After
        settling in, we went into the city center to Stephansdom. As soon as we walked out of the train, there was the
        Am Hof christmas market!
        We explored, got some food, and walked around the area. We walked towards Graben, where there were christmas
        chandeliers lining
        the street, it was stunning! From there we walked towards the Stephensplatz christmas market.
        <img id="chr" onmouseover="imageFlip()" src="christmas.JPG" alt="Rathausplatz" title="Christmas at Rathausplatz"
            width="300">
        All of the
        christmas markets surrounded
        the famous churches and monuments of Vienna. We got more food there, of course, and continued to explore. Not
        only did the
        decorations make it feel like the perfect christmas, but the snow was the cherry on top! It truly felt like
        winter wonderland.
        We continued to walk around, and towards the red bow. A gorgeous christmas addition!

    </p>

        After sightseeing, we decided to go to a bar, which are all in the same area near the college. Vienna is a very
        small city,
        and there's a tram going around the entire city, making it very easy to get around. We decided to go to a bar
        called Pickwiks,
        a perfect lowkey bar vibe. They had food, games, and lively energy, with an upstairs and downstairs. It was nice
        warming up in
        there after the cold day we just had. Pro tip: near the bars there's a great gyro place, get them on the way
        back!

    </p>

    <p>
        The next day was a christmas market overload! And the snow was coming down even harder. We went to have
        breakfast near the
        area called Hundertwasser Haus. We found a great brunch place, that had these picturesque windows so we could
        watch the snow
        fall. Trying to delay the inevitable freeze, we spent quite some time here talking and eating. After that, it
        was time for
        more sightseeing! We first started at Belveder, but unfortunately it wasn't open that day with the snow. We then
        went over
        to Hoffburg Palace, which was stunning. There was a really nice walk there, which I can only imagine is gorgeous
        when it's
        warm outside.
        <img id="glu" onmouseover="imgFli()" src="gluhwein.JPG" alt="Gluhwein" title="Gluhwein in Vienna" width="300">
        We walked over to St. Charles Church, and then Shönbrunn Palace. The architecture and buildings in
        Vienna are
        unreal. After this, we wanted to hit the last and largest christmas market of the trip. But we needed to warm up
        first.
        We stopped off in this tiny tavern called Einstein's, very close to the next christmas market. It was such a
        cozy vibe with
        traditional Viennese food, which we had to try. We then went to Rathausplatz, the largest christmas market in
        Vienna!
        It was
        super packed with so many things to do. If you go during this time, you must try the glühwein! It's a warm wine
        which sounds
        bad, but is actually really good, and perfect for the weather. There's also and Ice Skating Rink that takes you
        through the
        woods, and a carousel!

        For our last night we went to a bar called Dickmaks, coincidentally, right next to where we went the night
        before. This bar
        was fun, definitely more college vibes than usual. It wasn't my favorite place, but it was still pretty lowkey
        and chill.
        The next day we left early in the morning, closing off our trip to Vienna!
