    <h3>
        The trip of your dreams! If you're like me and Greece has been on your bucket list for forever, I have the best
        itinerary for you.
    </h3>
    <p>
        We started our trip off in Santorini. There are a lot of flights that go into that airport, and since it's at
        the bottom of the main islands, it's the perfect starting place. In Santorini we stayed in a charming <a
            href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/659066331294661841?source_impression_id=p3_1731097063_P3kWlZoue0DZLhA-"
            target="_blank">Airbnb</a>

        located somewhat near Fira. On our first night, we walked around nearby, and found a cute dinner place with
        authentic
        Greek food. As you can imagine, it was great!
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="left" src="oia.JPG" alt="Oia" title="Famous Blue Buildings in Oia" width="300">
        The next day we had a sunset boat tour at 3 PM. We booked this through GetYourGuide, where you can find lots of
        different options depending on your preferences. Before that, we walked over to Fira, walked around the town
        which
        had a lot of different shops. Pro tip: leave a little space in your suitcase, you're going to want to shop! The
        town is very
        picturesque and exactly what you imagine when you think of Greece. We went on the boat tour where they took us
        around the island,
        we were able to jump off the boat and swim, and they provided lots of snacks and dinner. It was so beautiful
        going around
        the island, and the water was so blue! After we got dropped off, we walked around a little more before going to
        <a href="https://www.kaliya-restaurant.com/" target="_blank">Kaliya</a>.
        We had originally intended to just go for drinks, but the menu looked too good, we ended up getting some food as
        well.
        The restaurant was very girly and cute inside with lots of pink flowers around the entire place!

    </p>

    <p>
        <img class="right" src="paroshotel.JPG" alt="Hotel" title="Mamma Mia Style Hotel" width="300">
        Next on the agenda, we were headed to Paros! However, our ferry wasn't until 3:45 PM so we had time to explore.
        The main thing when visiting Santorini is Oia. We taxi'd there, about a 20 minute drive from Fira, and walked
        around.
        We got lucky that our taxi driver offered to wait, and drive us to the ferry station after. Don't be afraid to
        ask, most
        of the time everyone is very willing to help!

        We walked around Oia, went to the main pictures spot, of course,
        and took lots
        of flicks. We had more time than we anticipated, so we were able to have a gorgeous lunch by the water. One
        thing to note, if
        you want to get good photos and not wait in line, try and get there as early as possible. We just missed the
        long lines that began
        to form after we left. The area in Oia is so cute and picturesque, there are so many stores you can walk in and
        out of while
        looking at all the beautiful artworks they have.

    </p>

        Next stop: Paros! Our hotel in Paros, <a href="https://mariolystudios-paros.gr/" target="_blank">Marioly
            Studios</a> was the most charming place, owned by a mother
        and daughter. It doesn't get more Mamma Mia than that.
        They were both so accomodating and helpful with anything and everything we asked for. It was located in Parikia,
        one of the main
        towns in Paros, with lots of restaurants. On our first night, we walked from the hotel towards the main
        restaurants earlier, and ate at one of the first ones we found.
        There were many options and we ended up trying out a good amount of them by the end of our trip in Paros.

    </p>

    <p>
        Our second day was a much needed chill beach day. We had gone in late April, so it was still off-season, meaning
        a lot of things weren't open yet.
        <img class="left" src="parosdinner.JPG" alt="Dinner" title="View from our Dinner" width="300">
        The owner of our hotel drove us out to Marcello Beach Club, supposed to be well known in Paros, but it was
        undergoing construction. However, she showed
        us another beach club, walking distance from the hotel that was perfect for us. The beach was secluded, the
        restaurant wasn't too packed, and the food was
        amazing! We spent most of our day on the beach, with towels we borrowed from the hotel, and going back and forth
        from the restaurant to get drinks.
        The water was crystal clear, and so refreshing! It was unreal to think that we were in the middle of Greece!
        After lounging for a while, we walked back into
        the main area of Parikia and walked around the different shops and sights in the town. It was quite secluded,
        but that added to the tranquility of our trip.
        For dinner, we walked to a place in between the beach and our hotel, which had seating right on the water. The
        sunset was gorgeous!


    </p>
    <p>
        Our last day in Paros took place in Naousa. This town is very well-known in Paros, and is usually the tourist
        stop.
        We spent most of our day here walking around the picturesque streets, exploring random places, like this church
        we
        happened to stumble upon, and shopping. We first grabbed lunch at <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/FotisAllDayBar/" target="_blank">Fotis All Day Bar</a> which had great
        food,
        perfect to get our energy up to start exploring. After walking around, seeing the different places, we went for
        our dinner
        reservations at <a href="https://m.paros-restaurants.gr/" target="_blank">Sigi Ikthios</a>, which is very
        well-known in Paros. This place is properly known for
        its dance party
        during dinner, but since it was off season, we sadly didn't get to experience that.
        <img class="right" src="parosstreet.JPG" alt="Street" title="Naousa Street" width="300">
        Paros is definitely a more
        underrated
        place in Greece, and not on the top of everyone's list. However, it has a unique charm that adds the Mamma Mia
        aspect into
        your Greek vacation!


    </p>
    <p>
        Stop three: Mykonos! We took our ferry in the morning and got to Mykonos in the afternoon.
        The transportation
        in Mykonos is limited, so be prepared to walk with your suitcases. We checked into our <a
            href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/22996392?source_impression_id=p3_1731097300_P3pDwqcMdrU68cXM"
            target="_blank">Airbnb</a> which
        was
        in the perfect spot! It had the cutest blue balcony right in a very picturesque street. We walked around the
        town
        and got lunch at <a href="https://souvlakistory.com/" target="_blank">Souvlaki Story</a>. You will have the best
        gyros here! There are so many different
        options
        all looking amazing! We continued to walk around and shop, before going back to get ready!

    </p>
    <p>

        We got dinner along the water, where the view was stunning! On our last day in Mykonos, we decided to go one of
        the
        beach clubs we found on a TikTok, lol. The sand on the beach was so so soft! We hung out there, the vibe was
        electric,
        we swam in the water, and enjoyed the atmosphere. If you go to Mykonos, you are sure to have a great time!

    </p>
    <p>
        Last stop is Athens! If you're going to Athens, be prepared to walk a lot. We got there late at night, and
        ordered in...guilty.

        The next day we woke up early because we had a lot of sites to see. From our <a
            href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/24366011?source_impression_id=p3_1731097391_P3KzYmJ7Vf-hTTFf"
            target="_blank">Airbnb</a>, we walked over to the
        Ancient Agora of Athens.
        <img class="left" src="mykonos.JPG" alt="mykonos" title="Mykonos Views" width="300">
        We got tickets at the door which were free! This will happen a lot especially on weekdays. After that we walked
        towards the Temple of
        Zeus, which was very easy to get in. Most of these sites you will be able to get tickets at the door. It was
        super cool to walk around
        these sites, an amazing experience. There was also a great view of the Acropolis on the hill. After that, we
        walked towards the Panathenaic
        Stadium, the oldest olympic stadium. This was so cool! We got to stand on the podium, run on the track, and sit
        in the throne at the end
        of the stadium. From here, we had time to kill until our dinner, so we walked to the national garden. On the way
        we stopped for some Greek
        frozen yogurt, delicious!


    </p>
    <p>
        We went to dinner at a place called <a href="https://dionysoszonars.gr/" target="_blank">Dionysos Zonar's</a>
        which had the perfect view of the Acropolis. We
        made
        our reservations for 7:30 PM, perfect for sunset. The food was amazing, definitely fine dining (only the best
        for our last
        night in Greece!). After dinner, we went back to the Airbnb and decided to go out.
        <img class="right" src="mainpic.jpg" alt="The Girls pt. 2" title="My Friends and I in Athens" width="300">
        After submitting my last paper of the
        semester...we went to the Gazi area, notorious for its nightlife.
        There are lots of fun bars in the area, and it's very
        lively and fun. Everyone in Athens are very friendly and welcoming!

    </p>

    <p>
        Greece is a dream come true! This itinerary is the perfect relaxing and adventure-filled trip with a mix of
        everything
        to make sure you don't get too burnt out. We went for 10 days, from April 9-19 (off-season, but still fun!).
