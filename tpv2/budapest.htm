        Budapest was the most underrated city I visited during my time abroad. Lots of things that you might hear is
        that there isn't much to do. That could not be more wrong. During our stay we stayed at <a
            href="https://www.wombats-hostels.com/budapest" target="_blank">Wombat's City Hostel</a>.
        This was a great place for such a short trip, and it was very accommodating! We got into Budapest very late, and
        took a longgg bus
        ride from the airport to the main city. The location of the hostel was perfect, easy to get to, and central to
        all the main attractions.

    </p>
    <p>
        The next day we woke up, and it was freezing. We put on our many layers and went to brunch. We ate at a
        restaurant
        close by but also on our list called <a href="https://cirkuszbp.hu/" target="_blank">Circusz</a>. The food was
        to die for, and the ambiance
        was
        energetic! If you want to eat here, I recommend allotting enough time, as there is a long wait. But, they do
        move the tables fast.

        After eating we decided to hit our first Christmas market! We went to St. Stephen's Basilica, a gorgeous
        monument with a festive
        Christmas market in front. It was so fun walking around the market, looking at the different souvenirs and
        Christmas goodies. One thing
        you must try is the spiked hot chocolate!


    </p>
    <p>
        From the basilica we walked over the danube river and got to stand in between Buda and Pest. If you didn't know
        the city
        is named from the two towns being officially merged. It was a very cloudy and snowy day, but still beautiful
        nonetheless.
        We walked from there to the Buda Castle, where they had gondola trips going up the hill. There is a way to walk
        up the hill,
        which I would recommend if the weather permits. The Buda Castle was beautiful, with lots of stunning
        architecture. To take a
        break from the cold, we decided to go into the National Gallery of Budapest, which was gorgeous! There were so
        many different
        types of artwork, and it was really nice walking around and warming up!

    </p>
    <p>

        The last stop of the day, before changing for dinner, was Fisherman's Bastion. Lucky for us, there was another
        Christmas Market!

        This place was so nice to walk around, cutely decorated for Christmas, and not too busy. It also had a gorgeous
        view of
        the famous parliament building, a great photo spot! We walked down the Christmas market, and also crossed off
        another church, Matthias Church!

        Now into the night! Budapest nightlife was one of my favorites throughout my trips. We started off the night by
        going to dinner at
        <a href="https://www.babkabudapest.hu/en/" target="_blank">Babka</a>, a last minute decision. We didn't have any
        reservations, but were able to get some
        seats by the window!
        The food was to die for. After dinner, we walked over to the prosecco boat tour, which was easily the highlight
        of our trip!
        These are really easy to book, and essential for any trip to Budapest. We booked ours through GetYourGuide, and
        chose a $30 option
        for unlimited prosecco, and some charcuterie! The views are amazing and you get the perfect photo op with the
        main parliament building.

        After the boat tour, we were not done. We had heard about this ruins bar, Szimpla Kertz, which was so cool!
        The drinks are cheap, and the atmosphere is very unique. Each room had a different design pulling from different
        ruins. After a few drinks here, and meeting a lot of new faces. People in Budapest are pretty friendly! We went
        to a club, Instant-Fogas Komplexum. This club was unique because it has 18 bars, 6 rooms, and 2 dance floors.
        Any kind of music you like, they are playing it! It's a great experience with lots of theatrical decor.
