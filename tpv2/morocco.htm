        Our trip to Morocco was nothing short of perfect! This trip was a week long, mostly located in Marrakech, and a
        night
        in the Agafay Desert. Follow this itinerary for a perfect experience!

    <p>
        We landed at 7:05 PM, and had a taxi waiting for us, which we
        booked
        through the Riad we stayed. The Riad we stayed at was called
        <a href="https://thecentralhousehostels.com/marrakech/" target="_blank">The Central House</a>, in Marrakech,
        Medina.
        We decided to have dinner at the Riad and had our first taste of proper Moroccan food. It was amazing!
    </p>
    <p>
        The next day we started off with brunch at <a href="https://lejardinmarrakech.com/" target="_blank">Le
            Jardin</a> where the food was to die for!
        The restaurant had many different seating areas, all very charming and surrounded in a garden-y layout.

    </p>

    <p>
        After eating, we walked around towards the Ben Youssef Madrasa. Walking around the souks in Marrakech is
        definitely one of the biggest highlights of the trip. There are so many different types of shops with little
        knick-knacks, souvenirs, and shoes! Lots of shoes. My friends and I all gave in and bought a shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we got to the Ben Youseff Madrasa, we walked around the place and it was stunning! We also took lots of
        photos, obviously.
        It's also important to note that if you're interested in visiting, make sure you are wearing clothes that
        keep your shoulders covered!
    </p>
    <p>
        After exploring there, we continued to walk around through the souks and towards the main market, Jemaa El-Fnaa.
        There were more shops in this area, in a more open layout. However, the highlight was the fresh orange juice
        they sold.
    </p>
    <p>
        After walking around a little more, we decided to head back and get ready for dinner! We got dinner and drinks
        at
        <a href="https://lmidamarrakech.com/en/" target="_blank">L'Mida</a>, a gorgeous place in the main area where we
        could watch the sunset! Make sure to
        make
        reservations as the place fills up fast!
    </p>
    <p>

        The next day we had plans to go see Le Jardin Majorelle. This is a must see in Marrakech, and we were super
        excited!
        We decided to go for breakfast at Bacha Coffee, which surprising to us, was in another little outdoor museum.
        <img id="mad" src="madrasa.jpg" alt="Ben Youssef" title="Ben Youssef Madrasa" width="300">
        We
        took
        some more photos, enjoyed the delicious coffee and went to the garden. One great thing about Marrakech, you can
        walk
        everywhere, even if it is scorching hot.
    </p>
    <p>
        The garden was stunning. There were so many photo spots as the entire garden was just beautiful all around! We
        took
        our time walking around, sitting at the benches and just admiring the beauty of the place.

        Unfortunately, the
        YSL museum
        connected to the museum was closed while we were there, but I definitely recommend checking it out.

    </p>
    <p>
        To end the day, we had reservations at a famous restaurant in Marrakech: <a
            href="https://www.comptoirmarrakech.com/" target="_blank">Comptoir Darna</a>.
        Since we had time to kill before our reservations, we walked nearby to Nobu, and got some drinks on the rooftop.
        It was stunning! If you have time I would definitely recommend going to check out the place, especially during
        sunset.
        After this we went to dinner, and it was a great time! The food was amazing, the drinks were flowing, and the
        atmosphere
        was electric.
        This is definitely a must eat when visiting Marrakech. The show was lots of fun, and very cool.

    </p>
    <p>
        The next day we went to the desert! The Agafay Desert is only a 50 minute drive from the main area in Marrakech,
        so we booked
        a car at the front desk of our Riad, and went on our way. The place was stunning! We stayed at a "glamping"
        campsite, <a href="https://www.selina.com/morocco/agafay/" target="_blank">Selina Agafay</a>.
        There was a cute "glamping" area with comfortable seating all around, family style dinners, and tents around the
        entire property.
        It was small but charming, and a great end to the trip. When we got there, we had some welcome drinks, got some
        food, and relaxed on the seating they had.
        They also had lots of cats roaming around the property, so cute! We signed up for camel riding at 6 PM through
        the campsite, and went on a sunset camel ride.
        The place was very accomdating and easy to navigate, making the trip that much better. At night we participated
        in the family dinner, having our last
        Moroccan meal of trip, so as you can imagine. We ordered everything possible. There was live music with the
        dinner and the environment was so nice, and peaceful!
