	<h2>What is the objective of your website?</h2>
	<p>The project objective is to provide itineraries and ideas for travel for students that are interested in studying abroad. The website will allow students to easily access ideas of places to go, be aware of cost-effective places for stay, and also know what are the best sights for each place.
		This website will include up to 10, maybe less, countries/places to visit with full itineraries. I'd also like to include links to different websites, for example for buying tickets for certain things.
